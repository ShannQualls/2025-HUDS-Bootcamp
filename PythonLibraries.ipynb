For instance, to install the math library named `math`, we would type `pip install math` and execute the cell. Python will find the module for the installer and begin unpacking the files, installing the library contents, and makes them available for use. It is important to note, the pip install should be run in a cell alone and without markup. The markup causes the pip install to fail and combining multiple pip installs can be okay but you will miss some of the essential messages at the end when it rapidly moves on to the next install.\n",

In most IDEs you would select Runtime from the file menu and select Restart Kernel.

Pandas answers the question of what would we do if we had hundreds of lists, each with hundreds of thousands (or many more) values but we wanted to see them all in one place. Pandas allows you to see the data in a dataframe or an organized representation of the data that can be manipulated and changed to suit the need of your analysis. Data Science relies heavily on Numpy and Pandas as the underlying framework for all of our analyses. Even our machine learning models require Numpy and Pandas to perform their work."

The charts are rendered in the coding environment and features an exploded view, where clicking on a specific data point, bar, or pie slice will expand the data to the full chart window allowing deeper insights into data. The user can draw a box around data points and isolate a region in the graph in the exploded view to investigate outliers.

This means if you program a new chart type you can add it to the library for other developers to use. Because of the open-source feel it is expanding rapidly and often features hybrid plots that would not have been previously used.\n",
